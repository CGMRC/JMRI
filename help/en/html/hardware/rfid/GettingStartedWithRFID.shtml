        <h1>JMRI: Getting Started with RFID</h1>
        <p>JMRI has numerous capabilities for working with RFID systems. This document integrates information from 
        <a href="#_Toc148">multiple sources</a> to describe how to use your RFID system with JMRI.  It will tell you
        how to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep track of where RFID readers are located on your layout</li>
          <li>Keep track of the RFID tag number attached to various pieces of rolling stock (engines and cars/wagons)</li>
          <li>Be notified when a particular RFID tag is seen at a particular reader</li>
          <li>Display that information and/or take action based on it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><a id="_Toc138">Five steps to tracking trains with RFID</a></h2>
        <p>If you have already made the decision about RFID readers and tags, and have created a Layout Editor or Control Panel
        Editor panel in JMRI that corresponds to your layout, here is what you have to do to start tracking your trains:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Attach an RFID Tag to a locomotive</li>
          <li>Set up a JMRI "connection" for your RFID Reader in Connections Preferences (PanelPro main menu: <strong>Edit&rArr;
          Preferences&rArr;Connections&rArr;”+”</strong>)</li>
          <li>Run the train so the reader reads the RFID tag. JMRI will automatically create entries in the <i>ID Tags Table</i>
          (for the RFID tag) and the <i>Reporter Table</i> (for the reader).  These can be viewed via the main
          PanelPro menu selection <strong>Tool&rArr;Tables&rArr;[Reporters, ID Tags]</strong></li>
          <li>Enter the locomotive ID (usually the cab number) into the "User Name" field in the <i>ID Tag Table</i> (right click
          on the "User Name" field and select <strong>Rename</strong>)</li>
          <li>Depending on which panel type you are using:
            <ul>
              <li>If you created a <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/LayoutEditor.shtml">Layout Editor Panel</a> you
              can see the train name for as long as it occupies a block: 
                <ul>
                  <li>If you haven't already created track "blocks," create one in the <i>Block Table</i> (PanelPro menu selection:
                  <strong>Tool&rArr;Tables&rArr;Blocks&rArr;[Click "Add"]</strong>). Find the new entry and assign the reader ID to
                  it by selecting from the pulldown in the "Reporter" field. <i>NOTE:</i> It is recommended that you NOT check the 
                  "Current" box which would clear the block value as soon as the RFID tag moves away from the reader.  See
                  <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/BlockTable.shtml">for more information.</a></li>
                  <li>Assign that block to the track on the panel that corresponds to the physical location of the RFID Reader:
                  Right-click on the track segment and select <strong>Edit</strong>; select the block name from the pulldown "Block Name".</li>
                  <li>In the panel edit window, check the box for "Block Contents" and select the name of the block whose value you want to display.</li>
                  <li>Shift-click on the panel where you want the value to appear. [It may be hard to see where that is if the value is
                  currently blank so consider putting a background or border.]
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>If you created a <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/ControlPanelEditor.shtml">Control Panel Editor Panel</a>
              you can see the train name for as long as the reader sees the RFID tag
                <ul>
                  <li>Select <strong>Add Items&rArr;Item Palette&rArr;Reporter</strong>, select the reader name and drag it to the panel.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's it! OK, step 5 can be a few steps itself, but now you can track your train from the time it is seen at an RFID reader as it
        occupies different blocks around your layout.  JMRI handles that part <a href="../../tools/tracker/index.shtml">automatically!</a></p>

        <h2><a id="_Toc139">Setting up RFID communication to JMRI</a></h2>
        <p>There are several ways to tell JMRI about your RFID readers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If your readers communicate via direct serial (USB) connection or TCP/IP, set up an “RFID Connection” on
            the Preferences Connections page (PanelPro main menu <strong>Edit&rArr;Preferences&rArr;Connections&rArr;”+”</strong>
            [Select "RFID" as "System Manufacturer")].
            JMRI will then create a <i>Reporter Table</i> entry automatically when a reader sends
            a properly formatted message through the indicated connection.  You will also see a new main menu item for <strong>RFID</strong>
            which gives you access to a command monitor and a <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rfid/swing/tagcarwin/TagMonitorPane.shtml">tag monitor </a>.
           <a href="images/PanelProMainRel554.jpg"><img src="images/PanelProMainRel554.jpg"
           height="650" width="285" style="text-align:right;" alt="JMRI PanelPro Main Window"></a>
          </li>
          <li>
            If your readers communicate via MQTT, you must first create an entry in the <i>Reporters Table</i> manually for each reader. Use the
            name by which the reader will send MQTT messages as the "System Name" (see the <a href="../mqtt/index.shtml">MQTT help pages</a>).    
          </li>
          <li>
            If your readers communicate via LocoNet, JMRI will create a <i>Reporter Table</i> entry automatically when a reader sends a properly
            formatted message through the indicated connection.
          </li>
          <li>
            Other methods may create <i>Reporter Table</i> entries automatically or require you to create them manually.  See <a href=  "../../tools/Reporters.shtml">Reporters Documentation</a> for more information.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="important">Using JMRI Version 5.5.4 or earlier, it is recommended NOT to add User Names in the Reporter Table 
        as this causes some confusion on JMRI startup. This issue has been <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/12433" target="_blank">
        documented in the JMRI code repository</a>.

        <h2><a id="_Toc140">JMRI Tables for RFID</a></h2>
        <p>
          JMRI stores information in tables that can be saved to files on your computer. All JMRI tables are
          available via the user interface of all JMRI systems (PanelPro, DecoderPro, and OperationsPro). Most
          tables used by PanelPro functions are stored in a combined xml file (sometimes called a "panel file"
          or "panel and table file") while OperationsPro and DecoderPro table contents are stored separately in
          individual xml files (see <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/LoadStoreWork.shtml">
          Loading Storing Your Work</a> for more information).
          </p>
          <p>These are the tables you will use with RFID:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>PanelPro Tables: viewable via the PanelPro menu selection <strong>Tool&rArr;Tables&rArr;
        [select table name]</strong>
        <p>
          <i>Reporter Table</i>: one entry per RFID reader necessary to recognize each RFID reader. 
          Entries may be created automatically the first time a message is received from an RFID reader
          depending on the communications protocol you use (see <a href="../../tools/Reporters.shtml">
          Reporters help page</a>). If an entry is not created automatically (or even if it would be), 
          you can create an entry manually. The Reporter Table contents is saved when you do a 
          <strong>File&rArr;Store ALL…</strong>) from the main PanelPro menu or elsewhere. 
          [<i>ADVANCED:</i> The <a href="../../tools/Reporters.shtml">Reporter Table</a> is also used for
          other kinds of reports from the layout, such as <a href="../loconet/Addressing.shtml#transponding">
          transponder</a> messages and <a href="../rps/index.shtml">real-time positioning system information
          </a>, hence its more general name.]
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>ID Tag Table</i>: entries are created and saved automatically when an ID tag is seen at a reader.
          See also: <a href="../../tools/IdTags.shtml">ID Tag Table help</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Block Table</i>: Blocks are defined groups of track on <i>Layout Editor Panels</i>.  An RFID reader
          can be assigned to a Block so that the ID Tag seen by that reader can be displayed on that panel.
          This is known as the "Block Value". Block Table contents is saved when you do a 
          <strong>File&rArr;Store ALL…</strong>) from the main PanelPro menu or elsewhere. 
          See <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/BlockTable.shtml"> Block Table help page</a>.

        <li>Operations Tables (if using OperationsPro): viewable via the main OperationsPro menu selection 
            <strong>OperationsPro&rArr;[select table name]</strong>
        <p>
          <i>Location Table</i>: this table, if used, has entries for track locations around your layout. Entries 
          can be created for locations at which you have RFID readers. The Location Table contents is
          saved automatically to a disk file.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Locomotive Table, Car Table</i>: these tables, if used, have entries for your rolling stock.
          Entries can be created for locomotives or cars (wagons) to which you have attached RFID tags.
          The Locomotive Table and the Car Table contents are saved automatically into separate files on disk.

        <li>DecoderPro Table viewable when via the PanelPro menu selection: <strong>Roster&rArr;Roster</strong>
        <p>
          <i>Roster</i>: contains one entry per locomotive in your fleet. While it allows you to
          enter a great deal of information about each, it does not currently (as of JMRI Version 5.5.4) have a specific 
          field for RFID tag. However, the Roster can be used to populate the Locomotive Table and RFID tag numbers can 
          be entered there.  The Roster contents is saved when you make changes and do a <strong>File&rArr;Save</strong>
          or “Save to Roster”. The Roster contents is saved into a separate xml file.

        <h2><a id="_Toc143">Linking PanelPro tables to display RFID Tag names when tags are read</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          While JMRI is an integrated set of systems, various pieces were implemented at different
          times by different people.  This means that some capabilities are not fully linked across functions and 
          some data may appear to be in the "wrong" place, missing, or replicated (as for example, with the 
          DecoderPro Roster and the OperationsPro Locomotive Table).  As a result, some types of data linking has 
          to be done manually to fully use all the JMRI functionality:
        <ul>
          <li>To see the name or number of a locomotive or car, you have to associate that number with an RFID tag number.</li>
          <li>To see the name or number of a locomotive or car appear on your Layout Editor Panel when it is 
          occupying a block that has an RFID reader, you have to link the RFID reader (Reporter Name) to
          the Block Table and put the Block Value on the Layout Panel.</li>
          <li>To see the name or number of a locomotive or car appear on your Control Panel Editor Panel when it
          is in front of an RFID reader, you have to put the Reporter (RFID reader name) on the CPE Panel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This section expands on the information <a href="_Toc138">above</a> to do this linking.  
        [<a href="_Toc141">Following sections</a> tell you how to link OperationsPro tables.]</p>
        
        <p>
          To identiy which RFID tag is attached to which piece of rolling stock, use the "User Name" 
          field in the <i>ID Tag Table</i>. Enter the locomotive or car number (must be unique) into the
          "User Name" by right-clicking on the field and selecting <strong>Rename</strong>). Other choices
          are <strong>Remove</strong> (useful if you mistype a number) or <strong>Move User Name</strong> if you are
          moving an RFID tag to a different piece of rolling stock. [If you are just getting started, a <a href="https://jmri.org/jython/AssignRFIDTagToRS.py" target="_blank">jython script</a> in the examples library will
          open a window for you to enter user names when RFID tags are encountered for the first time.]

        <p>
          If you created a <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/LayoutEditor.shtml">Layout Editor Panel</a> you
          can see the train name for as long as it occupies a block by linking RFID readers to blocks on the panel.
          Repeating instruction 5 above:
        </p>
        <ul>          
          <li>If you haven't already created track blocks, create them in the <i>Block Table</i> for each block that you want 
            to associate with an RFID reader (PanelPro menu selection: <strong>Tool&rArr;Tables&rArr;Blocks&rArr;[Click "Add"]
          </strong>). 
          <li>Find the new entry and assign the reader ID to it by selecting from the pulldown in the "Reporter" field.
            <i>NOTE:</i> It is recommended that you NOT check the "Current" box which would clear the block value as
            soon as the RFID tag moves away from the reader.  If you do, then you will only see the locomotive or car 
            name when the RFID tag is actually reported by the reader. See
            <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/BlockTable.shtml">for more information.</a></li>
          <li>Assign that block to the track on the panel that corresponds to the physical location of the RFID Reader:
            Right-click on the track segment and select <strong>Edit</strong>; select the block name from the pulldown "Block Name".</li>
          <li>In the panel edit window, check the box for "Block Contents" and select the name of the block whose value you want to display.</li>
          <li>Shift-click on the panel where you want the value to appear. [It may be hard to see where that is if the value is
          currently blank so consider putting a background or border.]</li>
        </ul>
       
        <p>If you created a <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/display/ControlPanelEditor.shtml">Control Panel Editor Panel</a>
           you can only display the "reports" from Reporters, i.e. the train name associated with an RFID tag, for as long as the
           reader reports that RFID tag. Once the reader report clears, the "report" is blank and the CPE Panels will not display 
           the name.  Unfortunately, CPE Panels do not have a way to display "Blocks" and "Block Values" but have their own concept
           of "Occupancy Blocks" (part of the <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/dispatcher/Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a>
           capability) which do not link to RFID information.
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>In the CPE Panel window, select <strong>Add Items&rArr;Item Palette&rArr;Reporter</strong>, select the reader name and drag it to the panel.</li>

        <h2><a id="_Toc141">Setting up the OperationsPro tables for RFID</a></h2>
        <p>To use RFID information with the Locations, Locomotive, and Car Tables, you first
          enable the assignment of ID Tags. This is done via the OperationsPro “settings” selection.
          Start on the main PanelPro menu and go to <strong>Tools&rArr;OperationsPro&rArr;Settings&rArr;Tools&rArr;Options&rArr;
          [scroll to “Options” near the bottom of the page]</strong>. Click the check box for
          &quot;Identification Tag Fields&quot;. If you now open the Locations Table, you will
          see an additional column labeled “Reporters” (for entering RFID Reader
          names). If you open either the Locomotive or Car Tables, you will see an “RFID” option in a box near the
          bottom of the window. Clicking on that will display the additional RFID information fields.  Note that this
          box must be re-checked each time the table windows are opened (i.e. it is not "sticky", as of JMRI Version
          5.5.4).
        </p>
        <a href="images/LocomotivesRel554.jpg"><img src="images/LocomotivesRel554.jpg"
        height="1158" width="289" alt="Locomotives Table used with RFID"></a>

        <p>Operational information related to RFID will be filled into the various tables automatically by JMRI as
        RFID tags are read around the layout – once you have entered the linking information between tables: 
        <ul>
          <li>RFID Reader names (Reporter names) can be linked to Locations</li> 
          <li>ID Tag names can be linked to Locomotives or Cars</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Edit Location window allows you to select a Reporter to associate with a particular location
          (<strong>OperationsPro&rArr;Locations&rArr;["Edit" a particular entry]</strong>).
          The RFID reader name can be added to the field "IdTag Reporter at this Location" on that window 
          from the drop down list. Readers listed in the <i>Reporters Table</i> will be listed.
        </p>
        <p>        
          The Edit Locomotive and Car windows allow you to select an RFID tag to associate with a particular
          piece of rolling stock (<strong>OperationsPro&rArr;(Locomotives, Cars)&rArr;
          ["Edit" a particular entry]</strong>).
          The RFID tag ID can be added to the field "RFID" on that window from the drop down list. ID Tags that have
          previously been seen by a reader or entered manually will be listed.    
          [If you are just starting and ID Tags are being seen for the first time, a jython script to aid in this

        <h3><a id="_Toc142">Short cut: Populating the Locomotive Table from the JMRI Roster</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you are just getting started in populating the <i>Locomotive Table</i>, JMRI provides a short
          cut. From the <i>Locomotive Table</i> menu, select <strong>Tools&rArr;Locomotive Roster&rArr;Import</strong>
          from JMRI Roster. Select which Roster Group or “All Entries” in the popup window, and JMRI will 
          create entries for the listed locomotives. Note that certain fields may be truncated (Owner) and 
          others may need editing (e.g. road name or model), but it is a start.<br> <strong>BE CAREFUL:</strong>
          if you add the wrong roster group, or you add the same one a second time, JMRI will add these 
          additional entries to the table. Luckily, you will find the file "OperationsLocomotiveRoster.xml.bak"
          in the "operations" subdirectory of the user files location.

        <p>
          If the above steps have been completed successfully, and if an appropriate reader is available to 
          sense an RFID tag, you are good to go! Here is what will happen when an RFID tag ID
          is sent to JMRI:
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>ID Tag Table:</i> If the ID Tag has been seen  before, JMRI will update the "When Seen" and "Where Seen"
          columns [see next step] in the corresponding <i>ID Tag Table</i> entry. If the ID tag has not been seen
          before, JMRI will create an entry, prefixing “ID” to the tag ID to create a "System Name", and will put 
          just the tag ID in the "Tag ID" column.
          The "User Name" column will be left blank and you can fill it in (or not) at any time. 
          [A jython script to aid in this process is  available at <a href="https://jmri.org/jython/AssignRFIDTagToRS.py" target="_blank">

        <p>
          <i>Reporter Table:</i> If an entry exists in the  Reporter Table for the RFID Reader received, the "Report"
          and "Last Report" columns will be filled in for the appropriate entry.
          If an entry does not exist, and the communication method is LocoNet or an RFID Connection method, an entry
          will be created and these fields will be filled in.

        <p>
          <i>Locomotive or Car Table:</i> If the RFID Reader is listed in either the Locomotive or the Car Tables, 
          the "Reported Date" (and time) column will be updated for the appropriate entry. If the RFID Reader is
          also associated with a particular Location in the "Locations Table", then the "Reported Location" column
          in the <i>Locomotive or Car Table</i> will also be filled in.
