      <h1>JMRI: ID Tags Documentation</h1>

      <h2>What are ID Tags?</h2>

      <p>An ID Tag is JMRI's way of representing information about ID Tags that can be attached to,
      for example, various items of rolling stock.</p>

      <p>When an ID Tag is read by a suitable reader (such as a connected 
      <a href="../hardware/rfid/index.sthml">RFID reader</a>), JMRI will put the value read into  a
      <a href="Reporters.shtml">Reporter</a> and set a <a href=
      "Sensors.shtml">Sensor</a> to ACTIVE . The ID Tag will also record which Reporter it was
      last seen by as well as the time it was last seen. [Note that there are other ways of getting
      information into the JMRI ID Tag Table, including via <a href="../hardware/mqtt/index.sthml">MQTT</a>
      messages and <a href="scripting/index.sthml">scripts.</a>]
      </p>

      <p>If an unknown ID Tag is detected by a reader, details of this tag will be automatically
      entered into the <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/IdTagTable.shtml">ID Tag
      Table</a>.</p>

      <p>At system shutdown, the details of all ID Tags known to the system are written to a file
      stored in the <strong>idtags</strong> sub-directory of the <strong>user files
      location</strong>. The storage of details when and where a given ID Tag was last seen is
      configurable by setting the option at the bottom of the ID Tag Table.</p>
      
      <p>For general information on using ID Tags with RFID Readers, see <a href="../hardware/rfid/GettingStartedWithRFID.shtml">
      Getting Started With RFID</a>.</p>

      <h2>How to setup ID Tags</h2>

      <h3>ID Tag Table</h3>

      <p>The <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/IdTagTable.shtml">ID Tag Table</a>
      provides easy access to the contents of all ID Tags that JMRI knows about.</p>

      <h3>ID Tag Table Controls</h3>

      <p>Below the table there's an <a href=
      "../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/IdTagAddEdit.shtml">"Add..." button</a> for creating your
      own ID Tags; JMRI automatically creates ID Tag objects for tags detected on the layout.</p>

      <p>Next to it, two check boxes let you activate:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Save when and where last seen</li>

        <li>Use Fast Clock Time</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Displaying ID Tags on Panels</h3>

      <p>An ID Tag can be displayed on a Panel via the use of the Reporter Icon associated with a
      given reader. To do this:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>On the Panel Editor window for your Panel, find the "Add Reporter" button.</li>

        <li>In the text box next to that button, type the User Name or System Name of the desired
        Reporter.</li>

        <li>Click the button. The Reporter icon will be placed on the Panel. If it's not visible,
        that might be because the value is currently blank; use the Reporter Table to change the
        value to something that will be visible.</li>

        <li>You can drag the icon to where you want it in the usual way.</li>

        <li>The pop-up menu on the Reporter Icon will let you change the formatting.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>More information about Reporters can be found in the <a href="Reporters.shtml">Reporters
      help page</a>.</p>

      <h3>Saving ID Tags to disk</h3>

      <p>ID Tags are not stored with the other tables. They have their own storage location as
      described in the first section.</p>
