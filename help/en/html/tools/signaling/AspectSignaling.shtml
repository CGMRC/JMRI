      "floatRight" alt="rule 282"></a> Protoypical signal systems present "<a href=
      "index.shtml#aspect">Aspects</a>" to the engineer to tell him how to run his train. The
      "Stop" aspect, for example, is pretty simple: "Stop the train". The "Approach medium" aspect
      indicates something more complicated: "Proceed approaching next signal at medium speed". Each
      aspect has an associated "indication", which is usually codified in a railroad's Rule Book.
      <p>The picture to the right shows an example, Rule 282 from the 1946 AAR rule book (Aspect:
      Approach Medium).</p>

      <a id="RouteSpeed"></a>
      <h2>"Route" signaling versus "Speed" signaling</h2>
      In U.S signaling, there are two basic "signaling systems": "Route signaling" 
      and "Speed signaling".
      
      <p>"Route signaling" 
      uses some "Aspects" that define "Indications" that apply <em>only</em> to 
      the "normal" route, and other "Aspects" that define "Indications" that apply
      <em>only</em> to the "diverging" (i.e. not-normal) route.  "Speed signaling",
      on the other hand, uses "Aspects" that do not specify a route, but do provide
      a maximum speed through the block or blocks governed, regardless of route.

      <H3>How to tell: "Route signaling" vs. "Speed signaling"?</h3>
      
      <p>"Route signaling" will generally use a term like "diverging route" in some 
        of a signal system's "Indication"s.  This will typically be seen in the 
        system's two-headed and three-headed signal masts.  Typically, a 
        "normal" route thru one (or more!) switch(es) "normal" will be "cleared" with the top 
        head as "other than red", regardless of the colors shown on the lower heads.
        Typically, an "other-than-normal" route (typically any one or more 
        switches in the route set as "diverging") will be cleared with the top 
        head as red and one or more of the other heads as "not red".
        <p>In "Route signaling", the engineer <em>needs</em> to understand how 
            the train can be handled, including what maximum speed the 
            actually-selected route can allow.  This implies that the engineer 
            <em>will</em> have a detailed-knowledge of the railroad's "Timetable",
            and will operate the train appropriately.
            <p>Prototype US railroads, largely in the Western US, 
            tended to use "Route signaling".
        <p>"Speed Signaling" is different.  The "speed signaling" signal does not 
            give much "hint" of the current route, but it <em>does</em> show that 
            the current route may be traversed per the instructions in the 
            "Indication", at the speed(s) as described in that "Indication".
            
            "Speed signaling" will generally use a term like "normal", "limited", 
            "medium", and "slow" in the signal system's "Indication"s.  The various 
            speeds are "encoded" in the ways in which a mast's heads are displayed, 
            <em>without</em> regard to the position(s) of any switch in the route.
            The signal system determines the appropriate speed(s) for the active 
            route, and displays an appropriate aspect given the allowable speed(s)
            in the current (and sometimes one or two blocks "in advance").
        <p>Prototype US railroads, largely in the Eastern US, tended to use 
            "Speed signaling".  More recently, some US railroads have been moving 
            "Speed signaling" to "Route signaling" signals (with all of the 
            challenges that implies).
        <p>JMRI supports "Route signaling" systems and "Speed signaling" systems.
            JMRI supports a "Route signaling" system (typically) whereby some 
            "Aspect"s apply to a "Normal" route, and other "Aspect"s apply to a 
            "Diverging" route.  JMRI supports "Speed signaling" systems (typically) 
            through routes that support <em>any</em> route but with a <em>specific</em> 
            maximum specified speed.  
        <p>(A JMRI signaling system may be implemented which does not quite 
            follow these guidelines; the person who did the coding of the 
            signaling system's "rules" thought that they had a valid reason to 
            implement an exception to those guidelines.)
      <h2>JMRI Support for Aspect Signaling</h2>

      <p>A collection of plain instructions let you set up <a href="SignalingSetup.shtml">Signaling
      in 7 Quick Steps</a>.</p>

      <p>Aspect Signaling is supported in JMRI using three of the Signaling Tools:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong><a href="SignalMasts.shtml">Signal Mast</a></strong> objects represent an entire
          signal with one or more Signal Heads. A Signal Mast can operate all its Heads, as
          required to do full prototypical signaling based on aspects. When its Aspect is set to
          e.g. "Approach medium", JMRI handles the layout communication needed to make the signal
          on the layout display the right colors.<br>
          <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SignalMasts-num.png"><img src=
          "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/images/SignalMasts-num.png" width="309" height=
          "83" class="floatRight" alt="signal mast table"></a> Signal Masts are configured through
          the <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastTable.shtml">Signal Mast
          Table</a>. You add new ones with the "Add..." button below the table, which takes you to
          the <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastAddEdit.shtml">"Add Signal
          Mast" window</a>. There you specify what kind of signaling system is to be used (see
          <a href="#systems">the list below</a>), the specific signal type eg. "double searchlight"
          or "double head dwarf" and which Signal Heads this Mast is going to drive.<br>
          You can add a Signal Mast icon in the Panel Editor by right clicking at any location and
          choosing "Add item &gt; Signal Mast".<br>
          In Layout Editor enter the Signal Mast address and shift click on a turnout or anchor
          point on the panel where you want to place a Signal. The Signal Mast icon will display
          the images specified in the appearance definition for that particular Signal Mast type
          and system. The Signal icons displayed on your panel are part of a Signal System and they
          can't be changed individually by the user like Turnout icons.<br>
          Image on the right: Rule 281 Signal Icons from the AAR-2 Signal System.
          <!-- icons from AAR-2 xml appearance definition xml March 2014 -->
           <a href="../../../../../xml/signals/AAR-1946/aspects.xml"><img src=
          "images/AAR-2Clear.png" width="187" height="187" class="floatRight" alt=
          "AAR rule 281"></a><br>
        </li>

        <li><strong><a href="SignalGroups.shtml">Signal Groups</a></strong> are used to define a
        number of Signal Heads, where only one Signal Head can be illuminated at any given time,
        depending upon the state of the associated Signal Mast and a set of conditions.<br>
        Signal Groups would be used where additional indicators are used to support the main Signal
        Mast, such as Junction, Route or Speed displays. These indicators provide additional
        information to the driver (US: Engineer) that is not given by the main Signal Mast. Such
        indicators are frequently seen in European and UK signaling.</li>

        <li>The <strong><a href="SignalMastLogic.shtml">Signal Mast Logic</a></strong> tool allows
        the Signaling Logic to be built up as pairs of conditionals between Signal Masts on the
        layout. The Signal Mast Logic will use the states of Blocks, Turnouts, Sensors and adjacent
        Signal Masts to determine what Aspect a Signal Mast should be displaying.<br>
        If the layout has been drawn up using the Layout Editor and Signal Masts have been placed
        on the panel using the various tools, then it is possible for all the Signal Mast Logic to
        be dynamically built, with little user intervention. For panels created with Control Panel
        Editor some of this information has to be entered manually.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong><a href="SignalHeads.shtml">Signal Head</a></strong> objects in JMRI are not aware
      of their position on a mast and the Signaling System they are part of, so as individual
      objects they can't show Signal Aspects. Individually they can only be set to specific
      <a href="index.shtml#appearance">Appearances</a> (colors), either from the Signal Head Table
      or via <a href="#logix">Logix</a>.</p>

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>

      <p>In short, a set of files for the selected Signaling System contains the basic code to
      determine which combinations are available in the <a href="SignalMastLogic.shtml">Signal Mast
      Logic</a> tool.<br>
      In the xml/signals directory located in the JMRI program directory, there is a directory for
      every Signaling System that has been defined, with one "aspects.xml" file which lists all of
      the possible Aspects plus a number of "appearance..." files (i.e.
      <em>appearance-one-searchlight.xml</em>), each of which describes the possible Aspects based
      on one Signal Mast type. These essentially say "if the next signal has an 'x' aspect, then
      the current one needs to show a 'y' aspect" (<a href="DefineNewAspects.shtml">more
      details</a>).<br>
      The Signal Mast Logic table is then used to check which Signal Mast pairs are active in the
      Signal Mast Logic and whether the Aspect should <em>not</em> be 'Stop'. This is done by
      looking at Turnout positions (if applicable), Block occupancy and - possibly - Sensors. On
      the Signal Masts tab you might even specify additional Signal Masts to watch, e.g. for an
      Interlocking. For any Signal Mast, there can be 1 to n destination Signal Masts, one of which
      is active based on the positions of Turnouts connecting the protected Blocks.<br>
      If everything is OK, then the appropriate "appearance..." file for this Signal Mast type will
      be used by the Signal Mast Logic to assign a new Aspect based on the Aspect of the next
      Signal Mast.<br>
      This covers the basic workings in a very high level overview. (Thanks to Dave Sand)</p>

      <h2 id="systems">Available Signaling Systems</h2>

      <p>JMRI users have provided signaling systems for
      <a href="../../../../../xml/signals/basic/index.shtml">Basic</a>,
      <a href="../../../../../xml/signals/AAR-1946/index.shtml">AAR-1946</a>,

      and many more.
      The complete list is at
      <a href=
      "../../../../../xml/signals/">https://www.jmri.org/xml/signals/</a>.</p>

      <p>To create your own Signaling System Definition follow these <a href=
      "DefineNewAspects.shtml">Instructions</a>. If you do create a new definition for another
      prototype railroad or era, after testing please contribute it back to the JMRI project so we
      can distribute it with future releases of the project for others to use. Like Decoder
      Definitions in DecoderPro, the more Signal System Definitions we have, the more useful the
      program becomes, and the more people spend time to improve it. We all win that way!</p>

      <h2>Code Access to Aspect Information</h2>

      <h3 id="logix">Logix</h3>

      <p>Signal Masts can be both tested (in Conditionals) and set (in Actions) via Logix. When
      you're editing a Logix Conditional or Action, you have to type the Signal Mast name and hit
      enter/return so that the program can look up the available Aspects for that particular Signal
      Mast.</p>

      <h3 id="mastscripting">Scripting</h3>

      <p>A program (in Java or Python) can get access to Aspect information in two ways. If the
      code has a reference to a specific Signal Mast "m", it can use</p>

      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
   m.getValidAspects()
</pre>to get the list of aspect names that this Signal Mast can display. The program can then
access the Signal System definition with

      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
   SignalSystem sys = m.getSignalSystem()
</pre>and then enquire about properties of the aspect:

      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
   sys.getProperty("Clear","speed");
</pre>where the first argument is the aspect name (use, for example, <code>m.getAspect()</code> to
obtain the current one on the mast) and the second is a specific property. Properties can be
defined programmatically via e.g. <code>m.setProperty("Clear","speed","69");</code> or get loaded
automatically from elements in the <a href="DefineNewAspects.shtml">aspect.xml</a> file that
defines the specific signal system.
      <p>In addition to the global properties for an Aspect, there can also be local properties to
      a specific Signal Mast type. An example of this is the default icon image: The image for a
      two-head Signal Mast is different from that for a one-head Signal Mast, even if they both
      represent "Clear".</p>

      <p>To get those:</p>

      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
   m.getAppearanceMap().getProperty("Clear","imagelink");
</pre>In words, this is saying "Get the Appeance info for this Signal Mast, and then check the
imagelink property of the Clear aspect".
      <p>Alternatively, if you know the name of the Signal System in use, a program can access it
      directly via the InstanceManager:</p>

      <pre style="font-family: monospace;">
   SignalSystem sys = InstanceManager.getDefault(SignalSystemManager.class).getSystem("basic");
</pre>
