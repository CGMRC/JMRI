      <p>
      LccTools is a 
      <a href="../../../../html/apps/index.shtml">JMRI application</a>
      that focuses on configuring your LCC network.
      </p>

        class="floatRight" height="255" width="466" alt="LccPro main window"></a>

      <p>
      The main LccTools window is a table showing all the LCC nodes on your network.
      Each row shows information about a single LCC node.
      If the node supports it, there are "Configure" and "Upgrade"
      buttons that will open functional windows for 
      <a href="../../../jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/networktree/NetworkTreePane.shtml#configure">configuring the node</a>
      and 
      <a href="../../../jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/downloader/LoaderFrame.shtml">upgrading its firmware</a>
      respectively.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      When you select a row, more information about that node is shown
      on the lower left.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Across the top is a tear-off set of buttons that will open
      other LCC tools, including 
      <ul>
        <li>The
            <a href="../../../jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/eventtable/EventTablePane.shtml">Event Table</a>
        <li>The
            <a href="../../../jmri/jmrix/AbstractMonFrame.shtml">LCC Traffic Monitor</a>
        <li>The
            <a href="../../../jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/stleditor/StlEditorPane.shtml">STL Editor</a>
      </ul>
      It also includes a "Refresh" button that will reload the table
      and a "Help" button that will bring you to this page.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      At the bottom of the window is a status bar containing the name of the currently
      configured connection, and an indicator of whether that LCC connection
      is currently active with traffic or not.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Because LccTools is a work in progress, the lower right region is not populated yet.  
      <a href=https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">Suggestions</a> 
      about what to put there would be appreciated!
