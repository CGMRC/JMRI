      <h1>Permissions</h1>

      <p><strong>Permissions</strong> is used to protect sensitive parts of JMRI, for example
      preventing the loading and storing of the <em>table content and panels</em> file by
      unauthorized users.</p>

      <h2>Settings</h2>

      <p><strong>Edit &rArr; Preferences &rArr; Permissions</strong> has the configuration for the
      permission manager.</p>

      <h3>Options</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Enable permission manager</dt>
          <dd>If selected, the permission manager will be active. You need to restart JMRI for the
          login/logout menu items to be available on the <strong>File</strong> menu. By default, the
          permission manager is disabled.</dd>

        <dt>Allow empty passwords</dt>
          <dd>If selected, empty passwords are allowed. By default, empty passwords are not allowed.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>Default users</h2>

      <h3>The current default users are</h3>
      <table>
          <tr><th>User</th><th>Password</th><th>Role</th></tr>
          <tr><td>admin</td><td>jmri</td><td>Administrator</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Guest</td><td></td><td>Guest</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>These two users cannot be deleted. If you don't want to use the <strong>admin</strong> user,
      you can unselect all the roles. It will then not have any permissions at all.</p>

      <p>New users will get the <strong>Standard user</strong> role when created.</p>

      <p>Note that the <strong>Guest</strong> user cannot have a password.</p>

      <h2>Default permissions</h2>
      <h3>The current permissions are</h3>
      <table>
          <tr><th>Permission</th><th>Roles with this permission as standard</th></tr>
          <tr><td>Edit preferences</td><td><strong>Administrator</strong></td></tr>
          <tr><td>Edit permissions</td><td><strong>Administrator</strong></td></tr>
          <tr><td>Change user's own password</td><td><strong>Administrator</strong> and <strong>Standard user</strong></td></tr>
          <tr><td>Load table content and panels</td><td><strong>Administrator</strong></td></tr>
          <tr><td>Store ALL table content and panels</td><td><strong>Administrator</strong></td></tr>
      </table>

      <h2>I have locked myself out! What do I do?</h2>

      <p>There are two options.</p>

      <p>The simplest way is to delete the file <strong>.permissions.xml</strong> in the
      PREFERENCES folder. Note: This is the <strong>Settings Location</strong> in <strong>Help &rArr;
      File Locations</strong>.</p>

      <p>By deleting the file, the permission configuration is removed.</p>

      <p>The second option is to edit that file with a text editor or an xml editor. The beginning
      of the file looks like this:</p>

      <pre>
&lt;Permissions&gt;
  &lt;Settings&gt;
    &lt;Enabled&gt;no&lt;/Enabled&gt;
    &lt;AllowEmptyPasswords&gt;no&lt;/AllowEmptyPasswords&gt;
  &lt;/Settings&gt;
  ...
&lt;/Permissions&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>Change <strong>&lt;Enabled&gt;yes&lt;/Enabled&gt;</strong> to
      <strong>&lt;Enabled&gt;no&lt;/Enabled&gt;</strong>.
      It disables permission checking but retains the permission configuration.
      </p>

      <h2>Securing the preferences</h2>

      <p>If an unauthorized user is able to delete or edit files on the computer running
      JMRI, he might be able to disable the permissions and then override them. See the section
      <strong>I have looked myself out!</strong> above.</p>

      <p>If you want to protect from that, you could protect that file from being changed.
      On Linux, it can be done by changing the owner of the file to <strong>root</strong> and to have
      it read only for other users. This assumes that the OS user that runs JMRI does not have OS
      administrative authority.</p>

      <pre>
sudo chown root ~/.jmri/.permissions.xml
sudo chmod 644 ~/.jmri/.permissions.xml
      </pre>

      <p>On Linux the .permissions.xml file can deleted even when write access is denied.  To prevent
      this, the <strong>.jmri</strong> parent directory also needs to be protected.  However, doing
      so can result in JMRI errors.</p>

      <h2>Connection failure during startup of JMRI</h2>

      <p>If JMRI is unable to connect to the layout during startup, a dialog is shown with the options
      <strong>Quit PanelPro</strong>, <strong>Continue</strong> and <strong>Edit connections</strong>.
      If the permission manager is enabled, the guest user probably doesn't have the permission to
      edit the connections. In this case, select <strong>Continue</strong> to start JMRI. When you
      do, a dialog will open with the message <strong>Permission denied</strong>. Ignore that, log
      in with an authorized user and then open the preferences. Now edit the connection.</p>
