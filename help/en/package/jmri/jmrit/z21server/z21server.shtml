      <h1>JMRI: Z21 Connected Throttle</h1>
      The Z21 server window controls the connection between Z21 throttles and JMRI. Currently supported are:
      <ul>
        <li>the Roco Z21 App</li>
        <li>the Roco WlanMaus (a WiFi Handheld)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It can be set to start automatically with the "<a href=
      "../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Startup">Start Up</a>" section in the "<a href=
      "../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml">JMRI Preferences</a>".</p>

<!-- maybe we add a Preferences page in the future...
      <p><a href="../../../apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Z21 Server">Preferences</a> for the Z21
      throttles can be found in the JMRI Preferences under the heading Z21 Server.</p>
-->
      <p>Currently there are no settings for the Z21 server, the server always listens on UDP port 21105.</p>

      <p>When using a Z21 throttle, if the computer enters sleep mode, control will be lost.
      System preferences may need to be adjusted to prevent the computer from putting itself to
      sleep when it is inactive.</p>

      <p>You can use any of these devices via the same or a different (remote) network than the one
      that your JMRI computer is running on. More information can be found in the
      <a href="../withrottle/UserInterface.shtml#remote">WiThrottle documentation</a>. Just replace
      "WiThrottle" with "Z21 Client".<p>

      <p>A description of the Z21 protocol can be downloaded from  <a href="https://www.z21.eu/de/downloads/anleitungen">this page</a>.
      For more on JMRI networking, see the <a href="../../../../html/doc/Technical/Networking.shtml">networking technical page</a>.</p>
      
      <h3 id="stopbutton">Stop button</h3>
      
      <p>The WlanMaus has a "STOP" button that can be used to either turn the power on/off or stop all locomotives,
      depending on the setting in the WlanMaus.
      The Z21 app also has such a button in the top right corner. The Z21 server supports both methods.</p>
      
      <h2 id="turnouts">Experimental support for turnouts</h2>
      
      <p>Both the Z21 app and the WlanMaus have the functionality to operate turnouts, but the turnout can only be selected by a number.
      Since JMRI has no concept of turnout numbers, a mapping of the turnout number to a JMRI turnout component is required.
      The current quick and easy method is to check if the comment field in the turnout table contains a number prefixed with "#",
      e.g. #101 for turnout W0101, as seen on the WlanMaus. This should be replaced by a better mapping in the future.</p>

      <h2 id="programming">CV Programming</h2>
      
      <p>Both devices also are designed to be able to program CVs. This is currently not supported by the JMRI Z21 Server.</p>
