      <h1>LocoNet LNSV1 Programming Pane</h1>

      <p><span class="since">since 5.12.3</span>The "Configure LocoIO (LNSV1) Modules" tool lets you access
      and program connected LocoNet devices that respond to the LNSV version 1 LocoNet
      programming protocol.<br>
      Examples are the classic and HDL LocoIO boards. You find the
      tool in the LocoNet menu as long as a LocoNet connection is available.</p>
      <img src="images/LNSV1Tool1.png" alt="Initial view of LNSV1 Programming Tool pane"> <img src=
      "images/LNSV1Tool2.png" alt="LNSV1 Programming Tool pane with Article and Address filled in">
      <p>As the tool is new, you might use it in combination with the "Show Raw Data" option in the
      <a href="../../locomon/LocoMonFrame.shtml">LocoNet Monitor</a> to check for any additional
      responses rejected by the LNSV1 filters.</p>

      <p>LNSV1 modules will respond to any Read and Write commands addresses to them
      (the Read and Write buttons in the tool are enabled during a session).</p>

      <h2>Module LNSV1 Programming</h2>

      <p>LNSV1 Programming requires 3 elements to address an SV in an LNSV1 module on LocoNet:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Low module address</li>

        <li>High module address</li>

        <li>CV number</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Enter the low address eg. 81 in the "low" field before proceeding.<br>
      Next, enter the high address part in the "high" field.</p>

      <p>After opening a programming session, the "Open Module Programming" stays highlighted and
      the Read and Write buttons are enabled.<br>
      To close the programming of a module, click the same button, that now reads "Stop Module
      Programming".<br>
      While a programming session is running this button is highlighted and the Address field is
      not editable, to prevent switching module address without first closing the session running.
      Note that changing the module address stored in CV0 won't immediately halt the session, so
      take care and close the current session before opening a new session on the new module
      address.</p>

      <p>For incidental programming, the tool allows reading and writing of individual CV
      value.<br>
      To read, enter a CV number in the fields on the right of the tool pane and click [Read] to
      see the value in the Value field.<br>
      To write, enter a CV number plus the new value to set in the CV, and click [Write].</p>

      <p>LNCV Responses coming back from the layout will be listed in the LNCV Monitor, and the
      devices sending a reply show up in the Devices table.</p>

      <p>When your Roster contains (exactly) one entry for a decoder of this article number and
      address, it will be listed in the table as the Roster Entry ID, as shown below.<br>
      When you have a matching Roster Entry, the button in teh Program column will read
      [Program] and will directly open the Roster Entry tabs.</p>
      <img src=
      "../../../../../../html/hardware/loconet/images/LncvProgrammer/LncvProgrammerPane.png" alt=
      "LNCV Programming Tool can't find a matching definition">

      <p>When no match was found in your Roster but a matching definition was found in the JMRI
      Decoder Index, the button will read [Create Entry]. Click on it and enter an ID (name)
      for your new roster entry.</p>
      <img src="images/LNSV1ToolEntry.png" alt=
      "LNCV Programming Tool ask for a name for the new Entry when you click Add Entry">
      <p>After clicking [OK] the button is updated to [Program].</p>
      <img src="images/LNSV1Tool3.png" alt="LNCV Programming Tool found a Decoder Entry and
      shows Program button">
      <p>Be sure to complete the Entry creation process by clicking [Save to Roster] on the
      DecoderPro Roster Entry tab.</p>

      <p>If your device responded to a general call but is not yet found in the Decoder Index,
      the button will read [No Match in Roster].<br>
      <span class="since">since 5.1.3</span>Click the button to get a dialog to recreate the
      Decoder Index, as a new decoder file that was copied to the user files /decoder folder
      might not yet be part of the Index.<br>
      If that doesn't fix it, report your device on the jmri_users group or create an Issue in
      GitHub.</p>

      <h2>Broadcast LNSV1 Programming</h2>

      <p class="important">Click "Start Broadcast Programming" to start a session.</p>

      <p>Older LNCV devices may not have their own address, or even no article ID. They can be
      programmed using Broadcast mode, but you have to be sure only one such device is powered, as
      they all would respond to programming commands.</p>

      <p>WARNING: this will change a value in ALL connected LocoIO etc. boards</p>

      <p>To close a Broadcast session, click "Stop Broadcast Programming".</p>

      <p>Using the universal address 65535 (or simply leaving the Article field empty) you can, as
      the name suggests, call up all LNSV1 Adapters that want to respond (not all do).<br>
      As the universal address is not valid for addressing specific modules, it can only be used to
      call up an individual adapter for which the address is unknown. For this you connect ONLY the said
      adapter to the LocoNet. The adapter can then be called up and its address read from LNCV
      0.<br>
      By only filling in an Article number (and leaving the address field empty) you can send a
      Broadcast call to all devices of that specific type, and many devices will respond by
      providing their DCC address, which will be added to the table.</p>
      <p>Once you have the report back from the layout, click [Close Broadcast Session] to exit the
      general access.<br>
      Click on one of the rows to copy the address to the top, and click [Start Module Programming]
      to continue.</p>

      <h2>LNSV1 Decoder definitions</h2>

      With an LNCV Module Programming session (to a specific device) running, you can use the
      Roster entry programming panes for more advanced (and accessible) configuration. Easily
      switch to DecoderPro Roster either by clicking the [Program] button in the table or manually
      open the entry for the module in your Roster entries list.<br>
      Go to the "LNCV (Booster) Configuration" tab to read and write options supported by the
      device.
      <p>Anyone interested in writing their own LNCV decoder definitions in JMRI, please note that
      in the definition programming mode should be defined as
      <code>&lt;mode&gt;LOCONETLNSV1MODE&lt;/mode&gt;</code>.<br>
      The Article part (item 1. in the list above) must be defined in the definition as the<br>
      <code>&lt;model productID="5033" /&gt;</code>. To process LNCV commands in JMRI
      LnOpsProgrammer, elements 1. and 3. are combined into a single CV number as
      "part_1.part_3".</p>
