    <h1>OpenLCB Event Table Frame</h1>
      <a href="Event_Table.png">

      This provides a table view of the Events, Producers and Consumers
      in your OpenLCB network.
      <p>
      You can resize and sort the columns using the header row.
      <p>
      Pressing the "Update from Network" button will load the table from the network.
      This might take a couple seconds.  You should press it again
      after changes like adding nodes, changing their configuration, etc.
      The table cannot detect those changes automatically.
      <p>
      If node names (4th and 6th columns) don't show up immediately, press
      "Update from Network" a second time.
      <p>
      If you have a configuration window open on one or more events and
      click "Update from Network", the right-hand column will show the
      tree-walking display of where each event is referenced in those
      configuration windows.  This can help you determine the function of
      the producers and consumers. Note that you might need to resize the column
      to see the complete entry.
      <p>
      You can enter names for events in the 2nd column.  Click on the cell
      to open it for editing. Hit return when done.  These will be
      saved automatically and loaded when you next start JMRI.
      <p>
      Checking the "Require label" box will display only events with labels.
      This lets you ignore events that you haven't labeled as interesting.
      <p>
      Checking the "Require both producer(s) and consumer(s)" box will
      display only those events that have both at least one producer
      and at least one consumer.  These are the events that actually do something
      on your LCC network.
      <p>
      Checking the "Popcorn mode" will highlight the producer for every event that
      JMRI sees being produced.
      Since the window scrolls to show the event, this can result in the screen
      jumping around when it's enabled.
      If there's a lot of traffic, this can slow your
      computer down significantly, so only enable it when you want to use it.
      <p>
      Entering an event ID in the find box and clicking "Find" will highlight every
      occurrence of that event.  The window will scroll to show the first one if needed.
