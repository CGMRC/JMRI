      <h1>Permissions</h1>

      <p><strong>Permissions</strong> is used to protect sensitive parts of JMRI, for example
      from unauthorized users to load and store panel and data files.</p>
      
      <h2>Default permissions</h2>
      <h3>The current permissions are</h3>
      <ul>
		  <li><strong>Edit preferences</strong> - The role <strong>Adminstrator</strong> has access.</li>
		  <li><strong>Edit permissions</strong> - The role <strong>Adminstrator</strong> has access.</li>
		  <li><strong>Load table content and panels</strong> - The role <strong>Adminstrator</strong> has access.</li>
		  <li><strong>Store ALL table content and panels</strong> - The role <strong>Adminstrator</strong> has access.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>I have looked myself out! What do I do?</h2>
      <p>There are two options.</p>
      <p>The simpliest way is to delete the file <strong>.permissions.xml</strong> in the
      PREFERENCES folder. On Linux that file is usually <strong>~/.jmri/.permissions.xml</strong>.
      By deleting that file, all the permission settings are removed.</p>
      
      <p>The second option is to edit that file with a text editor or an xml editor. The beginning
      of the file looks like this:
      <pre>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Permissions>
  <Settings>
    <Enabled>no</Enabled>
  </Settings>
  <Users>
    <User>
      </pre>
      
      Change <strong>&lt;Enabled&gt;yes&lt;/Enabled&gt;</strong> to
      <strong>&lt;Enabled&gt;no&lt;/Enabled&gt;</strong>.
      It disables the permissions but the users and their permission configuration is still kept.
      </p>
		  

      <h2>Securing the preferences</h2>
      <p>If an unauthorized user is able to delete or edit files on the computer running
      JMRI, he might be able to disable the permissions and then override them. See the section <strong>I have looked myself out!</strong> above.</p>
      
      <p>If you want to protect from that, you could protect that file from being changed or deleted.
      On Linux, it can be done by changing the owner of the file to <strong>root</strong> and to have
      it read only for other users.</p>
      
      <pre>
sudo chown root ~/.jmri/.permissions.xml
sudo chmod 644 ~/.jmri/.permissions.xml
      </pre>
      

      <h2>Connection failure during startup of JMRI</h2>
      <p>If JMRI is unable to connect to the layout during startup,
      a dialog is shown with the options <strong>Quit PanelPro</strong>,
      <strong>Continue</strong> and <strong>Edit connections</strong>.
      If the permission manager is enabled, the guest user probably
      doesn't have the permission to edit the connections. In this case,
      select <strong>Continue</strong> to start JMRI. When you do, a
      dialog will open with the message <strong>Permission denied.</strong>.
      Ignore that and log in and then open the preferences and then edit
      the connection.</p>
