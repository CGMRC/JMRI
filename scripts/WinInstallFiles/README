The definitive copy of LaunchJMRI.exe is kept in Git in this directory.  This 
keeps it stable in the interest of managing the large number of anti-virus 
approaches on Windows systems.

Should you need to recreate the LaunchJMRI.exe use 'ant launchjmri.exe` or

/opt/local/bin/makensis -V2 LaunchJMRI.nsi

Note that this ant target is not included in the package-windows target: We  do 
not remake the LaunchJMRI.exe file as part of the build of the release packages.  

Note that there have been problems reported doing this on MacOS, though others 
have made it work. Check that the length of the created file is reasonable.

When the "/debug" parameter is selected, the launcher opens a window that is 
independent of JAVA, that effectively contains "debugging log" that the 
Launcher functionality provides.  This window remains alive until JMRI exits, 
and the JAVA code returns a "completion" code to the Launcher.  If used from a 
"command prompt", this window must be closed before the command prompt can be
used for additional commands.

When the "/noisy" parameter is selected, the launcher opens a window that is 
independent of JAVA which effectively contains the JMRI "console log".  This 
window remains alive during the entire JMRI run.
