      <h1>JMRI: Basic Enhanced Signaling Definition</h1>
      This directory contains basic signaling definitions understood by many model railroaders.
      They don't model any specific prototype, but are similar to transition era ARR signaling
      techniques. This "basic-enhanced" definition is based on the "basic" definition and brings
      the following enhancements:

      <ol>
        <li>Addition of "Advanced Approach" aspect.</li>
        <li>Addition of a 3-head mast.</li>
        <li>All mast image files collected together under the "basic-enhanced" directory.</li>
        <li>Mast image files renamed to indicated displayed light color rather than a rule number
          <ul>
            <li>In the case of multi-head masts, colors are arranged top to bottom in filename.</li>
            <li>The light colors are represented as:
              <ul>
                <li>R = Red</li>
                <li>Y = Yellow</li>
                <li>FY = Flashing Yellow (with suffix to indicate animated or static gif)</li>
                <li>G = Green</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Example: "SL-2-high-G-R.gif" for a Searchlight two head high mast in Green over 
              Red appearance.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      </ol>

      <p><u><b>USAGE INFORMATION:</b></u>  When using the basic-enhanced signal system with Signal
        Mast Logic (SML) set the Global Thrown speed to Limited.  On Panel Pro window, navigate to 
        Tools>Tables>Turnouts page, select Speeds>Defaults... and selecting "Limited" from the 
        Thrown Speed pulldown.  By default, JMRI sets at the Global Thrown speed to "Restricted" 
        and the Global Closed speed to "Normal."
      </p>

      <p><u><b>USING SPEED TO SELECT SECONDARY DIVERGING ASPECTS:</b></u> When using the three-head 
        mast contained in this basic-enhanced signal system with SML, set the speed of the diverging 
        route to be signaled by the bottom head to "Medium".  This is easily accomplished by creating 
        a dummy block whose speed is set to "Medium" and including it in that route's logic with a 
        test setting of "Any State".  The dummy block is not part of the actual layout and does not 
        need to be placed on the layout panel.
      </p>

      <p>In JMRI, a route is either Normal or Diverging.  If a route contains even one turnout in 
        Thrown state, then that entire route is Diverging.  If a route contains two turnouts or two 
        crossovers, that means there are two diverging paths.  SML uses a route's speed to 
        determine which head on a mast is used to signal the second diverging path.  In the case 
        of the three head mast contained in the basic-enhanced signal system, the bottom head has 
        its speed set to Medium (slower than Limited) and is intended to signal this two-turnout 
        case.  It can be used to indicate the route will take the second of two successive, closely 
        spaced turnouts, or that the route passes through both closely spaced crossovers, as in the 
        case of a  three-track crossover move.  Usage of the dummy block set to Medium speed as 
        discussed above is an easy method to inform SML to use the bottom head to signal this 
        secondary route.

      </p>

      <p><u><b>DISCUSSION ON ROUTE SPEED:</b></u>  The speed of a given route between two Signal 
        Masts is equal to the slowest speed assigned to any element in the route.  When a block is 
        created, JMRI assigns the Global Normal speed to it.  By default this is "Normal" speed.  
        When a turnout is created, JMRI assigns the Global Normal speed to its Closed path and the 
        Global Thrown speed to its Thrown path.  These by default are "Normal" and "Restricting", 
        respectively.  The usage recommendation for the basic-enhanced signal system is the set the 
        Global Thrown speed to "Limited."  See above for instructions.  If a route between two masts 
        contains blocks and turnouts that are all Closed, then the speed of that route is the Global 
        Normal speed.  If a route contains a turnout in the Thrown state, the speed of that route is 
        the Global Thrown speed.  A route's speed can be modified individually by overriding the 
        defaults.  JMRI provides several options for doing this. For example, the speeds for 
        an element in the route, such as a turnout's path or a block, can be individually set, 
        or a virtual element can be created and included in that route to set the route's speed.  
        Remember that the slowest speed of any element in the route sets the speed of the entire 
        route.  The speed names (Restricted, Medium, etc) and their relative magnitude are found 
        in file xml/signals/signalSpeeds.xml located under the JMRI install directory.
